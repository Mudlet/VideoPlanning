# Purpose

To give a place to plan, write, and track various videos destined for the Mudlet youtube channel

## Tracking

Tracking is done via the project at https://github.com/orgs/Mudlet/projects/1 .

1. Add an idea for a video as a note in the Open column, and try to slot it about where you think it should fit in the production run
2. When you're ready to write the script for it, drag it to the `Script In Progress` column, and convert it into an issue in this repository.
3. When the script is written and ready for review, drag it to the `Script In Review` column. It should stay in this column for at least 2 days to allow time to review
4. If the script is not rejected and no changes are requested, you can then move the card to the `Recording Video` column when you are ready to start recording the raw footage and audio
5. Once the recording is complete, move it to Editing Video. It will remain here until you upload it to YouTube. 
6. Upload the video to YouTube as "Unlisted". If it is part of a playlist which is already listed, do not add it to the playlist yet. It should be left here for at least 2 days to allow time to review the video
7. If nobody objects to the video, it can be published and added to any relevant playlists. At this time it should be moved to `Published and Done` and the issue closed.

If at any point during this process it is decided to not complete a video, it should be moved to `Cancelled` and closed.

## Contribution

* I've added the mudlet org to this by and large I believe, so feel free to comment on the issues, suggest videos, help write scripts, etc.
* I'm recording the videos in OBS typically, at 60fps, and uploading them to youtube at 1080p. I'm currently experimenting with recording with my desktop resolution set to 1280x720 to keep it more legible on smaller screens
* I'm doing the video editing in DaVinci Resolve 17, which is available for free and makes the process fairly easy, and comes with simple effects built in.
