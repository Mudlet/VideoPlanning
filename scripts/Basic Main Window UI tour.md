Hello,

In this tutorial, I will cover all the elements of the Mudlet main window as of Mudlet 4.14, which is the latest release at the time of recording. 

Starting at the top, there is the menu bar. As you look through them, notice they will point out the shortcut keys which perform the same function as the menu item.

Under games there is Play, which opens the profile selection screen, Disconnect, and Reconnect.

The toolbox menu contains entries to open the script editor, as well as show the map, change the input line to compact mode which removes all the stuff to the right of the input line, open the notepad for taking notes, open up a connection to IRC, provide access to the package manager, load a replay (which is a diagnostic tool the developers use to troubleshoot issues), open the module manager, or open the package exporter.  The package manager, module manager, and package exporter will be covered in their own video. 

Options allows you to open the profile preferences, or if you have more than one profile open set it to multiview, which instead of having each profile be a tab splits the space vertically like so. (open a second profile and set multiview to show it, then close second profile.)

The Help menu contains links to helpful webpages for working with Mudlet, as well as our Discord help channel, the IRC client again, and our online forums.

In About, you can open the About Mudlet window (open the window for a moment, then close again), or check for updates (click, see no updates, click ok).

Beneath that, there is the Main Toolbar. This has buttons for largely the same things that the main menu bar has items for. On the left we have Connect, which opens the profile selection screen. You can click this arrow to drop down for the disconnect option as well.

The next 7 buttons on the toolbar open the script editor to specific sections, Triggers, Aliases, Timers, Buttons, Scripts, Keys, and Variables respectively. 

Then there's the Discord button. If your game has discord integration and has told Mudlet about it, then this button will take you to the discord for your game. If not, it will take you to the Mudlet discord. If you click this drop down, there is also another way to open the IRC chat window. Before Mudlet had a Discord, we used IRC for support and announcements, but it isn't used so much these days. To the right of this button is the Mudlet Chat button, which takes you to the Mudlet Discord. This button is only active if your game has its own discord, otherwise the Discord button serves that function.

Beside that we have Map, which will show or hide the map for Mudlet. The Manual button will open up the Mudlet manual on our wiki. Settings takes you to preferences, which will get its own video tour. Notepad opens the notepad for taking down notes.

Moving on, we come to the Packages button. Clicking this button will open the package manager. Clicking this drop down will provide access to the module manager and the package exporter. As I said earlier, these will get their own video, but for now just know they are a way of sharing code and functionality with other Mudlet users. 

The Replay button lets you load a replay, same as the menu bar option. Reconnect will reconnect you to your game, and Multiview turns on multiview. Report issue will open your web browser to our github to tell us what you found so we can take a look, and the about button opens the About Mudlet dialog. 

At the bottom of the screen is the input line. Starting on the left, we have the input line itself, where you type your commands and aliases for interacting with your game. You can cycle through your command history using the up and down arrows, and if you type the beginning of a command, it will cycle through commands in the history which start with the same text. It stretches most of the way across the window, until you get to the search box over here on the right. This allows you to search your main window for specific words or phrases to make finding things in the backscroll easier. To the right of that we have the buttons to show earlier or later results for the search. By default it will show the most recent result. This search is case sensitive.

Next to that is the timestamp button, which toggles timestamp visibility on and off, like so (demonstrate). Then there's the button to record a replay. What this does is record the information coming from your game, which can sometimes be useful to help the developers fix an issue. Most of the time, though, even we don't use them.

Next up is the logging button, which toggles logging on and off. And last but not least, we come to the emergency stop button. This halts all triggers and timers from running, which is useful for if you have a trigger which is causing an infinite loop or something like that. Hopefully you never need to hit this, but it's good to know where it is, just in case.

In today's video, we went over the UI for Mudlet's main window and briefly touched on what each item does. In future videos, we'll go over the Mudlet preferences window, the features of Mudlet's script editor, and ways to add your own custom interface elements to Mudlet. I hope this video was informative and helpful, and I look forward to creating and sharing the next one with you all. Until then, happing MUDding.
