## Script

Hello,

In this tutorial, I will cover how to download and install Mudlet for Linux.

First, you'll need to open your web browser and navigate to https://www.mudlet.org/download , which will bring up the Mudlet download page. It should pre-select the proper tab for your operating system, but if not you can click on it here to bring it up.

Then click here to download the latest release, or here to download the latest Public Test Build, or PTB. The release is the current stable version of Mudlet, and good for most users. The PTB is our nightly build, and has all the latest features and updates but may be slightly less stable, and updates as often as once a day. 

Once the download is complete, open the archive and extract the file somewhere easy to run it, I like to use the desktop. Then you can just double click to open Mudlet, then open a profile and begin playing.

In today's video, we went over how to download and install Mudlet on Linux. In future videos, we will explore the basics of scripting and interacting with your game via Lua, as well as the many other features Mudlet has. I hope this video was informative and helpful, and I look forward to creating and sharing the next one with you all. Until then, happing MUDding.
